							<h3>Introduction to Data Science <small>Assistant Professor</small></h3>
							<p>Welcome to data science! The class is designed to be application-forward -- demonstrating what you can do with the tools of data science in the hopes of motivating and encouraging students to go deeper and further. As an introductory class with no prerequisites, the statistical and programming fundamentals behind what we do is only briefly mentioned; the goal is to provide a sense of what can be done with data science rather than to provide a comprehensive foundation on a smaller set of topics. The contents of this repository represent a work-in-progress and revisions and edits are likely frequent.</p>

							<h3>Statistics for Political Research 1<small>Assistant Professor</small></h3>
							<p>This course will introduce students to the statistical methods used to study the political world. This is the first course in a sequence and assumes no background other than a passing knowledge of algebra and a little calculus. There will be an interactive lecture twice a week, as well as a section that meets with the TA approximately once a week. Questions are encouraged at all times; sections provide an opportunity to revisit the material and offer practice applying it.</p>

							<h3>American Constitutional Law <small>TA</small></h3>
							<p>This course examines the major contours of the American Constitution excluding the Bill of Rights. We will discuss constitutional law in the broader framework of social and political philosophy and explore evolution of judicial doctrine and jurisprudential theory through constitutional history. We will consider the Supreme Court as an institution in the context of autonomy claims concerning politics and adjudication, law and morality, legal positivism and realism, etc., and the extent to which these bear upon an enduring anxiety about judicial legitimacy, justification and interpretation.</p>

							<h3>Risk Analysis & Modeling <small>TA</small></h3>
							<p>This course is a graduate-level introductory course in quantitative risk analysis and modeling. The course will focus on the nature of risk, particularly as it affects decision-making in areas such as public policy legislation and regulation, economics and finance. In that context the use of mathematical models will be explored from simple deterministic models to more complex probabilistic models and Monte Carlo simulations. The conditions under which risk models are most useful will be explored, as well as the situations such as the occurrence of “black swan” events where risk models are prone to failure.</p>

							<h3>Quantitative Methods II <small>TA</small></h3>
							<p>This course provides a current perspective on identifying and estimating causal effects in social science research.

We will emphasize research design and robust estimation and inference.</p>

							<h3>Power & Politics in America <small>TA</small></h3>
							<p>This is an introductory course on the national politics of the United States. The course has four parts. First, we discuss the two “ingredients” that give American politics its particular flavor: America’s political institutions and America’s political culture. Second, we turn to elections and political parties, and show how they combine with a unique American phenomenon (strong interest groups) to produce the variant of representative democracy seen in the United States. Third, we turn to the institutions of American national governance: Congress, the President, and the judiciary, exploring the extent of their powers and the constraints faced by actors within these institutions. Finally, we assess the implications of all of this for the most important thing government produces: public policy.</p>

							<h3>Economic Development <small>TA</small></h3>
							<p>The course provides a big picture view of the Economic Development discipline through the current debate on the future of Economic Development. It answers the central questions: 1) why are some countries so much poorer than others?, 2) what are the main barriers to the process of economic development? and 3) why do those barriers exist and persist? This course provides an overview of how the discipline of Economic Development approaches these questions and to review its recent findings. It is required for students pursuing the specialization in Economic Development. Pre-requisites: Although most of the course will be presented in a non-technical fashion, there will be some formal economic models and review academic empirical papers. Students should be comfortable with basic economic concepts and should have completed or be concurrently enrolled in an intermediate level microeconomics course and econometrics or statistics. Students that do not fulfill this requirement should discuss their background with the professor before enrolling in the course.</p>
